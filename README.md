# Fraud Transaction Detection

## Background
### Problem Statement
In an era of global transactions, protecting the security of payment systems is now crucial. The 1.75 million cases January-June 2023 dataset provides a unique opportunity to explore global fraud with only 13.45% of transactions identified as fraudulent. This requires the development of adaptive predictive models to address this challenge.

### Objectives
My goal here is to explain how to predict and combat evolving patterns of fraud.

## Results
It is concluded that the developed model has achieved a high level of accuracy in recognizing fraudulent transactions. However, there are still opportunities for improvement, especially in overcoming the 4% error in predicting fraud because decision tree models tend to be less widely adaptable.
